      p I am a web developer with 4 years of commercial experience in interactive sound design for clients such as Orbotix, Tombolo Interactive, and Bolder Games.  Working as "the Audio Guy" within a larger group has shown me the importance of communication and organization when working on any project, and I'd like to bring these lessons to your development team.
